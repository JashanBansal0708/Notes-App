<-------    Best tools for debugging rather console.log() from node v8+ ------------>


// if we are on a server we don't have access to the chrome dev tools, at that time use command line tools.


node inspect app.js    ->   debugging via the command line  

n          ->    move to the next line for debugging

list(10)   ->    list 10 lines from the current line of debugging

c          ->    continous to the end of file , if not debugger is used

debugger   ->    used in between the file to create break points. Use c to move to break point.

repl       ->    used at a particular point of debugging for testing values
Example in debugging.js at start of line 7
person, person.age+ 100 , person.age = 100;


/////////  Important  ///////////////

node --inspect-brk      -> flag allow us to debug via the chrome developer tools 
open chrome://inspect
use ESC key to open hide console in sources tab
Very useful, give us a sneak peek of data

Also use nodemon
